                                <br /> Windows has highest software compatibility across the most popular OS contenders, with the majority of applications and video games being primarily written for it. The list includes the highly popular Microsoft Office
                                Suite, Adobe Creative Cloud as well as a large portion of video games, with Valve reporting that only 15% of games on their Steam platform support Linux.

                                <br /> Apple boasts that their Mac OS is great for productivity; whether that be creating documents, editing photos and videos or keeping in contact with friends and colleagues through iMessage and FaceTime.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Mac OS has native compatibility with Apple's other products such as the iPhone and iPad, allowing calendars, notes, messages and more to be synced across devices allowing the user to always be connected.

                                <br /> While Linux has a small market share for home and office use, the OS is primarily used for servers and embedded systems such as TVs and automobiles, with a 96.4% market share for web servers.
                                <br /> Linux is the primary choice for servers due to it being free, highly scalable and customizable and a highly secure kernel.

                                One of the main reasons behind Windows having such a large share is down to most general-purpose PCs having the OS pre-installed through their OEM partners. This is not the case for the likes of OS X which is only installed and compatible on Apple's Mac
                                range of computers.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Linux, while free and open-source, has the lowest adoption rate among home users mainly due to it being less user-friendly and not having compatibility with a lot of popular software from Microsoft Office to video
                                games, although in recent years there has been a big push to make more games accessible on Linux through a compatibility layer called Proton developed by Valve Software.
