                                The operating System commonly known as Linux was created in 1991. It is thanks to a Finnish computer science student, Linus Torvalds, that we can use this open-source operating System.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Moreover, Linux is the most used open-source operating System today. This software program oversees simultaneous management of the resources on a computer, such as disk space and computer memory, and enables communication
                                between the 'computer's software and hardware.

                            <p>
                                To elaborate further, the core function of Linux is run its own programs which manage the afore mentioned functions and potential devices that are attached to the computer, while also running programs initiated and requested by the user.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Much like UNIX, the core of Linux is "kernel". It is what powers the Linux operating system. Without it, the 'computer's software and hardware would be completely disconnected.

                            <p>
                                As an open-source operating system, Linux uses a type of kernel which is called "Monolithic Kernel". The tasks of this kernel are to encompass the CPU, memory, IPC, device drivers, file system management, and system server calls, while also being responsible
                                for handing off free system memory to applications.
                                <br />
                                <br /> One of the most distinct differences between open and closed-source is that an open-source project is such a software project which allows access to its source code. To put it simply, every single person who has
                                a computer and access to the internet can access and alter the source code of the Linux operating system if they had such intentions. Therefore, Linux has been modified by many developers since the year of its creation.

                                the Linux kernel along with other components of the overall System which were made for the users to customise it according to their needs.

                                <br /> Some of the major Linux companies that create these distributions are Red Hat, Canonical and SuSE.

                                Knowledge of the Linux operating system is one of the skills in highest demand on the job market in the IT field today. The number of sources grows continuously and warrants an equal or larger amount of research for one to keep up with all the new distros
                                being created.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Once you have decided to learn how to use Linux, a good starting point is where can we access the kernel. As users get more familiar with the commands and processes possible in Linux, they open the doors to many
                                potential applications and systems that rely on Linux in order to operate correctly.
