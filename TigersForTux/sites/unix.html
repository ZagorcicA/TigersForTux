                                Unix is a multiuser computer operating system, interface between the user and computer, which manages computer hardware and software resources. It is very known for its simplicity, ability to run on different operating systems, hierarchical file system,
                                and extensive amount of software offerings.

                                The first version of Unix was developed in 1969 by AT&T 'Corporation's Bell Laboratories as a result of the initiative to create a time-sharing computer system. Unix became quickly adapted for other computers and by the end of 1970s the team managed to
                                modify it to the PDP-11. Unix was further developing and new versions of it were created such us Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and System V. Today Unix is the basis of Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, and HP-UX. Unix was also
                                used as an inspiration and basis to Mac OS X and open-source operating systems such as Linux and many others.

                                Unix consists of three main parts: the kernel, the shell, and user commands / applications. The kernel separates the processes and users and regulates the access of system hardware. It also provides an interface to the process, memory, and I/O management.
                                The shell is an interface that reads the command line given and calls the necessary programs to do the work. The command lines given are defined as programs themselves.

                                As mentioned, Unix is a multiuser and multitasking whole package operating system. It can have more users logged into the System at once where each of them can run many programs parallelly. For Unix 'it's also important to know that it can only be used
                                by copyrighters, which means that 'it's not freely available to everyone. Unix is used in 'servers' workstations and PCs. If any kind of problems occur the users should be aware that they have to wait a certain amount of
                                time that the reported problem gets solved.

                                Many people use Unix and Linux as synonyms, although that is not the case. Linux is a clone of Unix, but they still have some core differences. Unix is a whole package operating systems used by copyrighters, where Linux is just a kernel freely available
                                to everyone and developed by sharing and creating codes by the community. Linux gained a bigger popularity than Unix and has a wider usage than the Unix does. When it comes to the file system support and security, Linux
                                showed both higher file support and security. Linux developed a higher demand and nowadays can be seen in many devices that are a part of our lives.
