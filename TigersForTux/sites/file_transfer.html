                        FTP or File Transfer Protocol stands for the process of transferring files over a network, which is desirable in larger businesses and companies since it is not necessary to be in the same space in order to share data.
                        <br />This transfer occurs between multiple devices and is triggered by one user allowing another to send or receive files via the Internet.
                        <br>
                        <br>Today, this protocol is used between private parties as well as by websites when uploading files to or downloading from their servers. Simply put, this is a protocol that enables multiple devices and computer systems to send/receive
                        and upload/download files on the internet.

                    <h2>
                        How does FTP work?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A protocol like this uses Cloud or a similar storage space to save all the files. Instead of Cloud, other secure locations that are held remotely can also be used to store and maintain the data. Therefore, in terms of web development, this is a mandatory
                        protocol for all who aspire to create and/or maintain websites.
                        <br />That being said, most web browsers feature FTP clients, which enable the execution of this protocol. To access it, the user will need to log in by using their username and password, after which they will be prompted to access
                        an FTP server through a port number. This can be bypassed by using servers that enable anonymous access to anyone with an internet connection who wishes to transfer files, but using your own credentials is a more secure approach.
                        <br />
                        <br /> After the user has logged in, most software will be easy to use. Straightforward programs like FileZilla are advisable to beginners, while also easy to use for experienced developers. This software is free and easy to download
                        and set up on a computer device.
                        <br />Once installed, the user needs to log in with afore mentioned information and add the address of the server they wish to access. The software establishes a connection and displays all the files stored in the server that user
                        specified. From here, the user controls the transfer of data accessible to them â€“ whether it is to upload, download or modify the files, as long as the permissions are set accordingly.

                        While the previously mentioned approach is locked behind log in information such as username, password and port number, there is another approach to client-server data transfer.
                        <br />
                        <br /> SFTP or SSH File Transfer Protocol is a secure file transfer protocol which runs over the SSH protocol. Also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, SSH is a network protocol which allows its users a secure way to
                        access a computer device when using an unsecured network.
                        <br />This protocol has substituted the afore mentioned FTP, due to its functionality and safety. Mainly, this protocol enables data transfer in a more reliable and secure environment while also providing easier configuration.

                    <p>
                        In terms of safety, SFTP is meant to protect against password sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks while also protecting the integrity of the data. Unlike FTP, this safe protocol uses encryption and cryptographic hash functions to shield the data, in
                        addition to authenticating both the server and the user.
                        <br />
                        <br />With these traits, in addition to its wide use for establishing secure channels between devices to perform the task of data transfer, SSH is also used to create secure tunnels for other different application protocols. With
                        SSH, the user can also manage routers, operating systems, server hardware and virtualization platforms.
                        <br /> SSH connection has been made to ensure many different types of secure communication between a local device and a remote host, including access to resources, remote execution of commands, delivery of new software patches
                        and latest updates, and perform a number of administrative or management tasks. This protocol is accessible to all Unix, Linux and iOS users by default.

                        To use SSH, the user connects to a remote host for a session within the terminal by ushering the following command to connect to a specific server: ssh UserName&#x40;SSHserver.
                        <br />
                        <br /> To perform tasks, the user needs to enter necessary SSH commands. In addition to the command, arguments need to be provided that would direct the software where to go and which directories and storage to target.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The following are some of the basic commands necessary for navigation through Shell:
