                    <p>
                        FileZilla Client is a tool used to access server sin order to execute and perform tasks for transferring files to or from a remote computer. This software uses a method known as FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
                        <br />It is an open-source software, much like Linux, which is easily installed to any computer device that has access to the internet. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS devices, which contributed to its popularity and wide
                        use.
                        <br />
                        <br />This program is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS and SFTP client with a variety of useful features and an easy-to-use user interface. To access a server through FileZilla, the user will need to log in by using
                        their username and password, after which they will be prompted to access an FTP server through a port number.

                        User guidelines

                    <p>
                        After the user has logged in, most software will be easy to use. Users connect by entering their username, password, por key number and the address of the server they wish to access. In addition to these features which differentiate it from unsecure software
                        that anyone can anonymously access, this is a straightforward program which is free and easy to download and set up on a computer.
                        <br />
                        <br />The software establishes a connection and displays all the files stored in the server that user specified. From here, the user controls the transfer of data accessible to them â€“ whether it is to upload, download or modify
                        the files, as long as the permissions are set accordingly. The main display which opens immediately after the log-in has been finalized, includes the menu, tool and Quickconnect bars.
                        <br />Once a connection has been established to a desired FTP site, FileZilla will log the messages, show the local and remote tree view, local and remote site view, transfer queue, and the status bar.
                        <br />
                        <br /> To create a new connection, the user opens the "File" menu and proceeds to Site Manager. Here, we select New Site after which we are prompted to enter a title of the website, and finally fill in the host's name. All of which
                        is finalized and confirmed with our username and password. Once done, click Connect.
                        <br />After a successful connection has been established, we will see wordpress files to the right of the screen, from where we are able to edit the files.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Advanced version of this software, in addition to all free features, also supports a number of protocols, such as FTPS, SFTP and provide Cloud storage options (e.g. Dropbox and Amazon S3). It also provides the queue option for the files meant to be uploaded,
                        copied, downloaded, etc. to or from a computer device.
                        <br />This allows its users to see a list of queued files that have not been processed through the specified command while also displaying failed and successful transfers. This way, it is possible to check the progress of the given
                        task at any moment by merely looking at the window of the program.
                        <br />
                        <br />With this in mind, the file transfer can be prioritized as per the user's needs and preferences. The files meant to be processed by this program can be specified as "queued" or "immediate", where queued are the files which
                        are to be processed at a later time, and immediate files are scheduled for an immediate transfer.
                        <br />
                        <br> In addition to aforementioned perks, FileZilla also comes with IPv6 support, tabbed user interface, bookmarks, "drag and drop" support, network configuration wizard, remote file editing option, synchronized directory browsing
                        and HTTP/1.1, SOCKS5 and FTP-Proxy support.
                        <br />The program is available in multiple languages to ensure easy use and a straightforward interface.
