                                To the surprise of many users, Linux is not reserved solely for IT enthusiasts. Since the use and application of Linux can be adjusted depending on the needs of the user, the areas and devices it is being and can be used on extends a lot further than
                                just an average computer.
                                <br />For instance, when it comes down to advanced applications used by governments and major companies, such as Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Walmart, and many others rely on Linux to perform the tasks necessary to enable the
                                highest level of functionality.

                            <p>
                                In regard to web development, many servers which can be used to host content, for example bots for specific applications, are in fact using Linux.
                                <br />
                                <br />Over the past few years, Linux became more popular and widely-used across various different platforms. With its open-source core code and numerous distros which are constantly being updated, it has been successfully
                                catching up with the rapid development of modern technology. The growing list of tasks which current users request are being effectively covered with Linux.

                            <p>
                                As a result, the complexity of tasks the users request, be it administrative tasks, configuration management or DevOps workloads has also grown at an equally exponential rate.
                                <br />
                                <br />Therefore, a need has appeared for these tasks to become part of an automated workflow, rather than remaining manual administrative operations, and this is where Linux system comes into play with all its perks and
                                benefits.

                            <p>
                                According to Siever (2009), the success that Linux as a project faced has inspired many such ideas and projects today, some of which are Samba and GNOME. Furthermore, it has also become a popular platform for development of Java.
                                <br />
                                <br />Its popularity is also a consequence of the fact that Linux is generally more secure than other operating systems and, when breached, is less vulnerable to widespread damage.
