                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                When it comes to Linux and OS X there always arises the question which one is better and recommended to use. The answer to that is simple; depends on users and their needs and wants.
                                <br />
                                <br />Both Linux and OS X have certain advantages and features the other does not posses and further we will explain what there are and which of them could be more suitable for someone’s.
                            </p>

                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                Linux is open source and more sittable for the business world because of its command line interface while OS X is made and protected by Apple which created an ease to work with appealing interface which is more user friendly in comparison to Linux.
                                <br />
                                <br />Since OS X is more regulated by Apple, the corporation provides regular updates which makes the OS free from bugs. With Linux its more likely that bugs occur. The OS X makes problems since its not capable to read
                                data from other file systems, while Linux can read data from other OS file systems.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                OS X supports just devices developed by the Apple corporation while Linux has a much wider range. Linux can be run on devices low configuration to super computers.
                                <br />
                                <br />The OS X kernel is based on UNIX where Linux is like UNIX. People should be aware that while using OS X, Apple has the possibility to monitor its users’ activities to a certain extent while with Linux the user is
                                free from investigation.

                            <p>
                                For users that are budget conscious they should probably consider Linux since its free. For gaming, Linux is the one that showed better results at this time.
                                <br />
                                <br />Linux allows customization; meaning a user can make it look and act according to its wishes. While getting the free products for Linux the user should be aware that the software’s aren’t as polished as they are for
                                Macs and Windows.

                                The OS X isn’t free, but its price is just 30 dollars. Mac offers packages that are cleaner and polished with products such as Adobe and Microsoft Office that are desirable for many users nowadays.
                                <br />
                                <br />When it comes to the software that Mac uses, most of them are not free to use and at a minimum cost of around 50-60 dollars. Mac cannot be customized as the user wishes since Apple protects its design and code.
